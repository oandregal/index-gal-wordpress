# DataViews example

## What is it?

This example aims to demo the `@wordpress/dataviews` [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/dataviews).

`@wordpress/dataviews` is a UI component developed by WordPress contributors as part of [the Gutenberg project](https://github.com/wordPress/gutenberg). DataViews is a component that provides an API to render datasets using different types of layouts (table, grid, list, etc.).

See [documentation](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/trunk/packages/dataviews) for more info.

npm install
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Coda

This demo has been bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for testing purposes as part of a [talk about WordPress](https://index.gal/). It favors educational code, it's not production ready.
