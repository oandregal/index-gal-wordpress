# WordPress at index.gal

This repo was created as a companion to this [talk about WordPress](https://oandre.gal/talks/wordpress-at-index-gal/).

It provides two examples of libraries created as part of WordPress that can be used anywhere.

- block-editor: how to create your own editor based on HTML&blocks. See related [tutorial](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg-framework/).
- dataviews: how to render your data using different layouts (table, grid, list)
